### Files

The folder contains three files
 * **Complex.hpp** - declaration of the `Complex` struct and 3 functions that works with it.
 * **Complex.cpp** - definitions of the 3 functions that operate on `Complex` struct.
 * **main.cpp** - the file that contains the `main` function, also contains two functions showing how the `Complex` struct is used.

### Notes

* **Complex.hpp** has an `.hpp` extension instead of `.h`, this is because `.h` is a **C** header file extension. `.hpp` is for **C++** header files. You can include `.h` header files in C++ projects without any problem but the reverse is not true. Another reason why you might want to have `.hpp` instead of `.h` is because you may use auto code formatting which has different rules for C and C++ files.
